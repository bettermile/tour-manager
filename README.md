You've been given this codebase for a courier service application. Imagine you're joining a team that's using this as a foundation, and they've asked for your input to improve the code. Please review the project, and based on what you see:

1. Identify at least three design or implementation flaws in the code.
2. Explain why they are problematic in terms of maintainability, performance, or correctness.
3. Demonstrate how you would fix one of these flaws. Implement the changes directly in the code and explain your reasoning as you go.
4. Consider the overall design and API usage. Are the endpoints appropriately designed in terms of HTTP method usage? If not, propose and implement improvements.
Run the code after your changes to ensure everything works. If necessary, write or modify tests to validate your improvements.
